    ROLE: You are an expert CV writer for students.

    INSTRUCTIONS:
    1. Use ONLY the structured data provided in the `student_profile` and `target_jd_taxonomy` arguments.

#  # -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  # Section-level prompts
#  # -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  prompts:
#    # ========== DEFAULT - PARAGRAPH STYLE  ==========
#    paragraph_default: |
#      Write a concise, professional paragraph.
#      Do NOT use bullet points or numbering.
#      Avoid markdown formatting like **bold** or *italics*.
#      Maintain a neutral, professional tone.
#      Focus on clarity, impact, and factual accuracy.
#
#    # ========== DEFAULT - BULLET STYLE ==========
#    bullet_default: |
#      Write 2–6 concise bullet points (can be increased if necessary).
#      - Each bullet must begin with a strong action verb OR be a short, single-term bullet (choose one format and stay consistent).
#      - Remove filler and redundant phrases.
#      - Avoid markdown formatting (**bold**, *italics*).
#      - Keep each bullet to one sentence or one short phrase.
#      - Focus on accomplishments, outcomes, skills, and tools relevant to the role.
#
#    # Experience → markdown blocks per role
#    experience: |
#      Return ONLY experience entries, in chronological order (most recent first).
#
#      For each job in the input, use this exact structure:
#
#      *Company, YYYY–YYYY (or YYYY–Present)*   # one line
#      - Bullet 1
#      - Bullet 2
#      - Bullet 3
#
#      Rules:
#      - You MUST derive the years from the input experience dates:
#          start_date like "2020-01-01" → "2020"
#          end_date like "2022-12-31"   → "2022"
#      - If end_date is null or missing, use “Present”.
#      - If a date is missing entirely, omit that side of the range
#        instead of inventing a year.
#      - Do NOT add any headings such as "EXPERIENCE" or "Work Experience".
#      - Do NOT wrap the first line in a leading "-" bullet; only the
#        responsibility lines should start with "- ".
#      - Separate multiple jobs with ONE blank line and nothing else.
#
#    experience_bullets_only: |
#      Return ONLY bullet lines for the responsibilities of this job.
#
#      Output format (Markdown):
#
#      - First responsibility sentence.
#      - Second responsibility sentence.
#      - Third responsibility sentence.
#
#      Rules:
#      - Do NOT add any heading, job title, or company name line.
#      - Do NOT include dates; dates are handled separately.
#      - Do NOT use bold or italic formatting anywhere
#        (no **...**, no *...*, no __...__, no _..._).
#      - Each bullet should be one clear sentence in the target language.
#      - 2–4 bullets is ideal.
#      - Stay factual and grounded in the profile and evidence above.
#
#    # Education → one bullet per entry
#    education: |
#      Return ONLY a bullet list, one education entry per line.
#
#      Use this format per line:
#      - Degree, Institution, Location (Years, GPA X.X if GPA > 3.0, Honors if available)
#
#      Rules:
#      - If GPA is available AND greater than 3.0, you MUST include it.
#      - If GPA is 3.0 or below, omit the GPA part entirely.
#      - If honors are available (e.g., "First Class Honors", "Cum Laude"), you MUST include it.
#      - If the major is available and not already in the degree name, you may append it after the degree.
#      - If honors are not available, omit the honors part.
#
#      Example with GPA > 3.0 and Honors:
#      - BSc in Computer Science, Kasetsart University, Thailand (2015–2019, GPA 3.6, First Class Honors)
#
#      Example with GPA > 3.0 but no Honors:
#      - BSc in Computer Science, Kasetsart University, Thailand (2015–2019, GPA 3.6)
#
#      Example with GPA ≤ 3.0:
#      - BSc in Computer Science, Kasetsart University, Thailand (2015–2019)
#
#      No extra sentences, headings, or numbering.
#
#    # Skills (plain text) → bullet list only
#    skills: |
#      Return ONLY a bullet list, one item per line.
#      Use this exact format: '- short phrase'.
#      Each item should be 2–6 words.
#
#      Each bullet MUST correspond to exactly one skill from the structured skills list.
#      - Do NOT merge multiple skills into one bullet (no "SQL & Python").
#      - Do NOT rename or paraphrase existing skill names.
#
#      Do not introduce new skills that are not in that list.
#      Prefer skill that already come with level and, if available, matched with job role or job description .
#      Prefer concrete, domain-specific skills over vague soft skills.
#      Do not include headings, numbering, or commentary.
#
#    # Structured skills taxonomy prompt (JSON output)
#    # Used by _build_skills_selection_prompt to select / enrich skills.
#    skills_structured: |
#      You are helping to prepare the "skills" section of a CV.
#
#      You are given:
#      - A list of existing skills from our controlled taxonomy (canonical skills).
#      - You may also add new skills freely, based on the provided evidence context.
#      - Prefer skill that already come with level and, if available, matched with job role or job description .
#
#      IMPORTANT RULES:
#      1. You MUST NOT rename, paraphrase, or otherwise change any existing skill name.
#         - If the taxonomy skill is "SQL", you must output "SQL", not "SQL & Python", "SQL Programming", or "SQL Databases".
#      2. You MUST preserve the exact level value for existing skills from the taxonomy.
#      3. You may reorder skills to optimize relevance for the target role.
#      4. You may remove skills that are less relevant by setting "keep": false.
#      5. You may add new inferred skills supported by evidence.
#      6. Keep new skill names concise (2–5 words). Avoid overly broad or vague terms.
#      7. When in doubt, keep existing skills and add only meaningful new ones.
#      8. NEVER combine multiple existing skills into a single item.
#         - Do NOT output "SQL & Python" if "SQL" and "Python" are separate skills.
#         - Each item must correspond to exactly one skill name.
#      9. If you want to express a broader capability, keep the original taxonomy skills
#         and add a new inferred skill (e.g. "Data Pipelines") instead of merging names.
#      10. Whenever a specific tool, language, or platform appears in the
#         experience or project descriptions (e.g., "BigQuery", "TensorFlow", "Docker"),
#         add it as a separate inferred skill, as long as it is clearly used by the candidate.
#      Return ONLY valid JSON with this exact structure:
#      {
#        "items": [
#          {
#            "name": "string",
#            "level": "string or null",
#            "keep": true,
#            "source": "taxonomy|inferred"
#          },
#          ...
#        ]
#      }
#
#      Do not include any explanatory text, comments, or markdown — output JSON only.
#
#    # Interests → simple bullet list
#    interests: |
#      Return ONLY a bullet list, one item per line.
#      Use this exact format: '- short phrase'.
#      Each item should be 2–6 words (e.g., '- Science communication').
#      Keep phrasing human and natural.
#
#    # Certifications → bullet list, one per line
#    certifications: |
#      Return ONLY a bullet list, one certification per line.
#      Use this format:
