# Generic defaults
# -------------------------------------------------------------------
default: |

  Stay factual and grounded in the profile and evidence provided.
  Make the text easy to skim for a recruiter.

user_draft_rewrite_suffix: |
  Rewrite the above draft so it is clearer, more concise, and more impactful.
  Do not copy sentences verbatim; rephrase entirely in your own words while preserving factual accuracy.
  Treat this draft as raw information — you may enrich it with relevant details drawn from other sections
  (such as experience, education, or achievements) if it helps improve clarity or flow.
  Maintain a consistent professional tone and ensure the structure matches the expected output format.

# -------------------------------------------------------------------
# Profile summary
# -------------------------------------------------------------------

  Use 3–5 sentences in a single paragraph, no bullet points.
  Briefly cover:
    - current role or field of study,
    - key strengths and technical / domain expertise,
    - relevant achievements or impact,
    - overall career direction or interests.
  Keep the tone confident but not exaggerated.

# -------------------------------------------------------------------
# Skills (text section) + structured skills (JSON)
# -------------------------------------------------------------------
skills: |
  Write the skills section as a concise bulleted list.
  Group related skills together where appropriate (e.g. Programming, Data, Tools).
  Each bullet should start with "- " and list a short set of skills separated by commas.
  Focus on skills that are clearly supported by the profile and evidence.
  Do not invent unrelated skills or tools that are not implied by the profile.
  Do not add headings or subheadings; only bullets.

skills_structured: |
  You will generate a structured list of skills for this CV.
  Use the canonical skills (with levels) as the primary source of truth.
  You may:
    - keep canonical skills as-is,
    - drop clearly irrelevant skills,
    - add new skills that are strongly implied by the profile and evidence.
  Every skill must be backed by the profile, experience, or education; do not hallucinate.

  IMPORTANT OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
  - Return ONLY valid JSON, with no markdown, comments, or extra text.
  - Preferred format is an object with an "items" list:
      {
        "items": [
          { "name": "Skill name", "level": "Intermediate", "source": "taxonomy" },
          { "name": "Another skill", "level": "Advanced",    "source": "inferred" }
        ]
      }
    If you must return a bare list, it MUST be:
      [
        { "name": "...", "level": "...", "source": "..." },
        ...
      ]
  - For each item:
      - name:   a short, human-readable skill name in the target language.
      - level:  a simple textual level such as "Beginner", "Intermediate", "Advanced",
                or reuse the level labels provided by the canonical skills.
      - source: "taxonomy" for canonical skills, "inferred" for newly inferred skills.

  Do NOT include any explanatory prose in the JSON.

# Experience: style guide + bullets-only generator
# -------------------------------------------------------------------
experience: |
  This is a style guide for the work experience section of a CV.
  The section will be rendered with one header per role (job title, company, dates)
  followed by bullet points describing responsibilities and achievements.

  Style rules for the bullets:
    - Use concise, action-oriented bullets starting with strong verbs (e.g. "Led", "Implemented", "Improved").
    - Focus on achievements, impact, and outcomes rather than generic duties.
    - Where possible, include metrics or concrete results (e.g. "% improvement", time saved, scale).
    - Keep each bullet to one sentence, avoiding unnecessary filler.
    - Avoid first-person pronouns ("I", "we") and keep a consistent professional tone.
    - Avoid copying text directly from the profile; paraphrase and condense.

        - Starts with a strong action verb (e.g. "Led", "Designed", "Implemented", "Optimized").
        - Focuses on responsibilities, achievements, and measurable outcomes.
